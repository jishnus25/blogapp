After cloning the project from GitHub, navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs\blogapp). Run php artisan migrate to set up the necessary database tables based on the migrations. If there are any seeders, such as AdminSeeder, you can run php artisan db:seed --class=AdminSeeder to populate the database with the required initial data. Once these steps are completed, the project will be ready to run locally.
